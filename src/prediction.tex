% TODO talk about the predictions

% Outline svm and rf and how the data is used to make predictions based on the visualization

The visualization of the data collected about the projects help provide insights into data set. The visualizations created provided a more general look of the data collected. While other visualizations could be created to provide for refined views a perdiction tool was selected to provide support to developers more directly. Rather than present the data to allow for the developers to identify trends and patterns within the data set machine learning algorithms were employeed. These advanced algorithms are commonly used in research for pattern recognition. %TODO cite.

This leads back to the research question of this work, can changes within a project be predicted using machine learning algorithms. The
