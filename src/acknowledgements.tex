\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Acknowledgments}

I would first like to thank my thesis advisor Dr. Bradbury of the Computer Science Faculty at the University of Ontario Institute of Technology. Dr. Bradbury was always available to provide direction and feedback about both research and writing.

I would also like to thank the Dr. Szlichta for his thoughtful advice and recommendations throughout the work on this thesis.

To my colleagues at the University of Ontario Institute of Technology and lab mates in the Software Quality Research Lab, thank you for the stimulating discussions throughout the last two years.

Finally, I must express my very profound gratitude to my family and friends for providing me with unfailing support and continuous encouragement throughout my years of study, research and writing. This accomplishment would not have been possible without them. Thank you.
