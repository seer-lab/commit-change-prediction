% Elevator pitch:
Project development requires a large amount of changes to be made to a project. Any change to a project can introduce new faults which will cost more time and money to the project owners. We're proposing a technique that will predict whether elements within a project will change in the short term future given the development history of the project. The development history is collected from source code management tools such as GitHub. The predictions are developed using the machine learning approach Support Vector Machine. To validate the results several* open source projects are selected and analyzed. The prediction results for the specific projects prove to be useful* to accurately track future changes of the project.
