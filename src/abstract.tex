% Elevator pitch:
Software project development requires a large amount of changes to be made to a project. Any change to a project can introduce new faults which will cost more time and money to the project owners. Therefore is it feasible to predict future code changes from commit history using either Support Vector Machines or Random Forest? Also as a follow up, what factors have the most impact on the performance of predicting using either Support Vector Machines or Random Forest with future code changes using commit history? We are proposing a technique that will predict whether elements within a project will change in the near future given the development history of the project. The development history is collected from source code management tools such as GitHub and stored local in a PostgreSQL. The predictions are developed using the machine learning approaches Support Vector Machine and Random Forest. To validate the results the open source software projects acra, storm, fresco, dagger, and deeplearning4j were selected and analyzed. The prediction results for the specific projects prove to be useful in certain cases to accurately predict future changes of the project.

% TODO integrate results from experiments.
